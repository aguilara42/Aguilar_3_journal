The hardest challenge that I had yesterday was the multiplication workshop. In this program you must take two numbers from the outbox and multiply them. To do this i put the first ion the floor in slots 1 and 3. Then I took the second number subtracted one and put it in the 2nd slot. After this I subtrated one and added the first slot to the third. I did this until the second solot was equal to zero.
