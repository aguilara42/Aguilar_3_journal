myMap[67][43] the x coordinate is 43 and the y is the 57. if (i=0){ System.out.print("8888");  if the i is 0 it will print 8888 meaning at each first row postion in an array System.out.print(map[i][j]); this will print the array with the values of i and j from the for loops.  System.out.println("."); For each value of the array a . will br printed.  System.out.println(map[i][j]); This again will print the array at the end of the for loop. To use a boolean in a while loop it will run as long as taht varible is true boolean test = true; while(test){} Static will make a varible the same throughout the whole program, static int points = 0; In my game I could easily create an enemy class and call it from the game class by; static org = new Enemy();
