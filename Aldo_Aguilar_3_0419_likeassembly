After playing through human resource machine and reviewing some examples of assembly code there are very noticable similarities. The cmp and jmp commands in assembly are just like the jump command in HRM. In HRM there was a jump if zero, in assembly it is JE and in HRM there was a jump if a negative, in assembly it is JLE. The two are also structured in the same linear form of programing.
