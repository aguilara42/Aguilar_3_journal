We typed elf64 because this is the format for a 64-bit executable. In contrast elf32 is a executable for a 32-bit system. The ld command we use acts as a complier so that we can run our little program. chmod alters the permisson of a specified file, we created the sample.asm and it did not need an intermdient complier. I had to change the "was this easy" to my name and then recomplie it.Assembly is not quick and easy it is a lot more direct to the computer. Low level means that it is coding closer to the hardware of the computer.
