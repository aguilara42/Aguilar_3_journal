My questions 
In my game how would I check to see if the orb hits a wall?
How do I make the orb stay in place once it hits the wall?
Can I add an explosion effect to the orb once it hits an object?

Many questions I heard
A lot of people were having issues adding the lwjgl liberay.
Once they copied the example they forgot to rename the class.
Many people were just compeletly lost.
Some people had issues with the case sensitvity.
