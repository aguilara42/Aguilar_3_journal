I was able to rember the x and y from the slick game and how we used a 2d array as the map cooridnets. I am wondering how printing a 3D array would work. How to create a graphic print. If it is possible to print in a window rather than netbeans output. Why the x and y are switched in postion relative to functional graphing. If you can mke a 2D string and int array. A boolean array. Can ceritan ranges of a 2D array be boolean and a the rest be ints? Can you create an array that stores objects. Arrays that store arrays. how to make a real time game rather than turn based, the first steep is to stop using the scanner since it will only take lines in. I am also intrested in how to make a save game. On the exam I can predict that a few questions will be on arrays, then on the differnece between 2d and a normal array (and arraylist).
