I think on my test I missed a few eroors in notation and when I used an array to assgin the variables I did not do that correctly. To improve and be more successful I wish I would have been able to create a class better, I missused my getters and setters on the test. Within the class I did not properly assgin values in my getters and in my setters. I should assgin and return the private variables value in these methods. Also I didn't fully understand the portion asking to assgin corrdinets with an array.
