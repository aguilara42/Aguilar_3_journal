Students are encourged to learn CS because it is not like most subjects. It is like a langauge, there are things that would be simple to memorize; however, if you use logic to solve a problem you can do more. An example is learing how a for loop works. A for loop is very powerful and can be used to a set task a certian amount of times. You can memorize how to write a for loop, but if you learn to write it you can use it as many times as you like; weather you want to repeat a task 5 or 100 times, you can only alter a for loop if you learn it. What we should take from CS is the skill of taking something and appling it to many other related things. Like learning how to do a math process not just memorizing the equation.
