The most difficult challenge that I have encountered so far was the Exclusive Lounge level. In the level you must send same signs to the inbox but if they have different signs they must go to the inbox as a 1. This was so hard because I had to find a way to check if they were not only negative but also positive. I used a series of if negitive and if positive that alternated to see if ther were different signs.
