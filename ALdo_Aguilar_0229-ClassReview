1. How do we make a class?
	public class Donut {
			
	}

2. Donut Bismarck = new Donut();
is this a class constructor?
No, it is creating another donut - it's calling the class constructor with Donut();
3. How do we make a class with values and a class constructor?

public class Breakfast{
	boolean hasOrangeJuice;
	boolean hasEggs;
	int numOfEggs;
	int slicesOfBacon;
	
	Breakfas(int a, int b, boolean c, boolean d){
	this.numOf Eggs = a;
	this.slicesOfBacon = b;
	this.hasOrangeJuice = c;
	this.hasEggs = d;
	
	
	} 
	
	//A getter gets things i.e, namely in java and oop
	//A getter is usually public so that it can return private values
	//e.g. a getter for slices of bacon tells the main program, or 
	//other classes how many slices of bacon.
	
	public int getSlicesOfBacon(){
		return this.slicesOfBacon;

	}

	//A getter returns a value by contrast a setter sets values.
	//For example to set weather we have orange juice or not

	public void setHasOrangeJuice(boolean a){
		this.hasOrangeJuice = a;
		
	}
}


4.An array of Breakfast
int [] numbers; //This is an array of numbers

Breakfast rodersBreakfast = new Breakfast(2, 4, true, true);

Breakfast [] rodersFamilesBreakfast = {rodersBreakfast, papasBreakfast, mamasBreakfast, sisBreakfast, abuelaBreakfast, abueloBreakfast};

5. Using getters and setters:
rodersBreakfast.setSlicesOfBacon(20);
//This is using a setter!!!!
