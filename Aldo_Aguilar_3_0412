The hardest problem that I solved was the octupler. This was hard just because it was only using additon. The logic I used was to add then add the larger sum together by copying it to the floor and doing this to 8 times. The first step was to take a number from the inbox and place it onto the ground. Once I did this I copied it next to itself in slot 2. I added slot 2 to slot 1. I then added 1 to itself 2 more times, the sum was equal to the product of the 1st term times 8.
