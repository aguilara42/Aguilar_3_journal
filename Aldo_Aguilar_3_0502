 An array is a set of the same data types, like an array of ints could be 4, 5, 5, 76, 5; where 4 is in the 0 postion. A simple array of Stings contians diffrent strings it is made like; Strings[] food = {fries, soda, eggs}; The syentex for a 2d array is such; int[3][6] test; a 3d array extends just one more dimension and can be writen as such; int[][][] myThird; A while loop will run as long as a specfic condition is met; while(1 = 1){}; A while loop is good for running when something is always met, like while player is on the board keep runbning the program. To call our game method in main it won't be hard it will look like; game(); meaning that the main method will call the game method. It is recommed to use that format with scanners becasue it is common practice when naming objects; newScanner(); To check for intersection a while loop will call a method to see if the player stays on the board, to move each method will be called in the game for a specfic direction from an if statment. ex if(move == e){ east();} The values that will be passed into the methods, most commonly, will be the player's input.
