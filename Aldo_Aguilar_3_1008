My thoughts on this project is that it may be a little difficult to start but as I get into it, it will get easier. I will use diffrent methods to draw many shapes, a for loop will be used to make patterns. Condinal statments will be used to vary the patterns I makes and math will be used to change a group of shapes or pick a location for them.
