public class Ogre{


    private static int x;
    private static int y;
    private static int HP;
    private static String symbol;
    private static int score;
    private static int level;

    Enemy(int a, int b) {
        this.x = a;
        this.y = b;
        this.HP = 10;
        symbol = "E ";
        score = 0;
        level = 1;
    }
}

For creating the object as an array in my main class I would
public static Ogre[] orgers = new Orger[2];
