On our project we have decided to create a piano with mutiple speakers. So far we have used buttons to create sounds and almot made mutiple speakers work at once. We need to find out how to change the frequency of each button and perfect mutiple speakers at once. Friday we will have a rough draft but a working project. We have made input from a user control the button and not made many functions yet.
