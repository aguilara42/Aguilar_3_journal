in my slick game you collect lettuce and avoid enemies. The challenges I solved were class issues and trouble shoting my game. I did not finish my map over winter break, I used a basic map(still diffrent tileset), I was able to pace myself fine making it sooner would have improved the quailty. I was able to meet the time line by using my time wisly, and if I didn't work in class I did it at home.
